# FAForever Python Web API
This repository holds the web api (written in python) that is run on the server to
provide required REST services to clients.

# Documentation

Currently documentation is sparse. Please help us out!

## Installation - Docker

Get [docker](http://docker.com).

Quick overview of Docker can be found:
[Docker Quick Start Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/quickstart/)

First you must install and configure the database component [faf-db](https://github.com/FAForever/db)
You can either manually install the component and follow the instructions on the Github page or run the script - init_and_wait_for_db.sh (Linux and MAC only)
In order to run the script,, make it executable by running

    chmod +x init_and_wait_for_db.sh

Now you can run the script by typing (You will need netcat installed on the computer)

    ./init_and_wait_for_db.sh

Modify config.example.py with the correct database parameters

If you used the script, then the script should be changed to the following

    DATABASE = dict(
        db=os.getenv("FAF_DB_NAME", "faf_test"),
        user=os.getenv("FAF_DB_LOGIN", "root"),
        password=os.getenv("FAF_DB_PASSWORD", "pbanana"),
        host=os.getenv("DB_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR", "127.0.0.1"),
        port=int(os.getenv("DB_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT", "3306")))

Build the container using

    docker build -t faf-api .

Run using

    docker run -d --name faf-api --link faf-db:db faf-api

Check to see if running by looking at the container and netstat

    docker ps

Find containers IP (Container ID can be found under docker ps)

    docker inspect <container_id> (IP is under IPAddress in NetworkSettings)

With the containers IP you can access the API by going to http://IP:8080/ranked1v1

If you would like to access the IP through an easy URL, then modify yours hosts file /etc/hosts

    IP dev.faforever.com

You can then access the API by going to http://dev.faforever.com:8080

Logs are viewable by

    docker logs faf-api
